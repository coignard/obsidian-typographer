# Typographer for Obsidian

Typographer is a plugin for enhancing your writing with correct typography. I created it to automate the use of smart quotes, custom text replacements, and auto-pairing of characters like guillemets.

The plugin works in the background as you type, ignoring code blocks, frontmatter, and other areas where you wouldn't want these changes.

## Features

-   **Smart Quotes**: Automatically converts straight quotes (`"`) into typographic ("curly") quotes as you type. You can define your own opening and closing quotation marks (e.g., `«»` or `“”`).
-   **Custom Text Replacements**: Set up your own rules to replace character sequences. For example, automatically change `!=` to `≠` or `<<` to `«`.
-   **Auto-Pairing**: Define pairs of characters that should be automatically closed. For example, typing `«` can automatically insert its closing counterpart `»` and place the cursor in between.
-   **Configurable Rules**: All replacement and auto-pairing rules can be added, edited, or removed from the settings menu.

## How to Install

1.  Open **Settings** in Obsidian.
2.  Go to **Community plugins** and make sure that «Restricted mode» is turned **off**.
3.  Click **Browse** to open the community plugins store.
4.  Search for «Typographer».
5.  Click **Install**, and then **Enable** once it has downloaded.

## How to Use

The plugin is active as soon as you enable it. Its behaviour can be fully customised from the settings panel.

### Settings

You can find the settings under `Settings` → `Community Plugins` → `Typographer`.

-   **Smart quotes**: A master switch to enable or disable automatic conversion of straight quotes.
    -   **Opening/Closing quotation mark**: Specify the characters you want to use for your typographic quotes.
-   **Auto-pairing rules**: A section to manage rules for characters that should be paired automatically (e.g., brackets or custom quotes).
-   **Text replacement rules**: A section to manage rules for sequences that should be replaced automatically as you type.
